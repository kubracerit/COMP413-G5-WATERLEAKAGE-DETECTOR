# COMP413-G5-WATERLEAKAGE-DETECTOR
IOT PROJECT-ABDULKADİR KÖSE

This project presents a Smart Water Leakage Detection System designed for indoor environments using ESP32 and IoT technologies. The system continuously monitors water leakage at two different locations (Living Room and Kitchen), classifies the severity of the leak using a TinyML-inspired rule-based classifier, and provides real-time alerts via a cloud dashboard (Blynk IoT).

Key Features
•	Dual water leakage sensors
•	Real-time cloud monitoring
•	Intelligent severity classification (Normal, Detecting, Minor, Major)
•	Event-based alert notification
•	Physical alerts using LEDs and buzzer
•	Timestamped alerts using NTP time synchronization

Set-up Instructions
1.	Connect the ESP32 to a WiFi network.
2.	Configure Blynk Template ID and Auth Token.
3.	Connect water sensors to ESP32 analog input pins.
4.	Upload the source code using Arduino IDE.
5.	Open the Blynk mobile/web dashboard to monitor live data.
